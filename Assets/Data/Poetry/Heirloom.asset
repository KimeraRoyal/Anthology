  m_text: 'a perfect heirloom, that

    hand-craft glass passed

    down from my
    mother,

    priceless and useless, an

    object of contempt.


    just once
    it finds meaning,

    lobbed against drywall it

    smashes into pieces and

    embeds
    in my arm.


    legacy pours out, that

    warm trickle of blood,

    slowly
    dribbling.'
