  m_text: "the animal is in me,\r\nhere. it is nourished\r\nby boombox voice\r\nproudly
    child of the \r\naspirin age this sinking \r\n\r\ndistance is a cruelty. sleepwalked\r\narms
    outstretched tongue-tied \r\ncherry-stem modesty fed by \r\nfreedom in soft coos
    isolation corners me\r\n motherly. Embarrassment-\r\n\r\nbroken-eye-contact-ribs
    somber\r\nsweetly dragged with furry licks\r\nfaint when trying to stand couched
    \r\nself assured worries in crevices\r\n\r\nof gnashing fangs, hackles up\r\nat
    something new keep greedily \r\nlicking at wounds contented\r\nproduct of auto-erotic
    flagellation\r"
