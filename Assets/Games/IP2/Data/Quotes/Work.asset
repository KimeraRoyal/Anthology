  - Hmm... I wish I were at the {0} right now.
  - My job is not very fulfilling.
  - I love my job!
  - Maybe I should think about finding a new job...
  - Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime...
  - I don't want to go to the {0} later...
  - The {0} has been boring lately.
  - Is this all there is?
  - Could there be more to life than the {0}?
  - Glad I'm not working right now.
